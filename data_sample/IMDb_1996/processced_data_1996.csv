He tries various schemes to come up with money needed for a reason that is never really explained. It has to be assumed that his huge embezzlement of money from the dealership is about to be discovered by father-in-law. When all else falls through, plans he set in motion earlier for two men to kidnap his wife for ransom to be paid by her wealthy father (who doesn't seem to have the time of day for son-in-law). From the moment of the kidnapping, things go wrong and what was supposed to be a non-violent affair turns bloody with more blood added by the minute. Jerry is upset at the bloodshed, which turns loose a pregnant sheriff from Brainerd, MN who is tenacious in attempting to solve the three murders in her jurisdiction.","black comedy,botched crime,neo

Jim Phelps (Jon Voight) was sent to Prague for a mission to prevent the theft of classified material. His wife Claire (Emmanuelle Béart) and his trusted partner Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) were members of Phelps' team. Unfortunately, something went horribly wrong and the mission failed, leaving Ethan Hunt the seemingly lone survivor. After he reported the failed mission, Kittridge (Henry Czerny), the head of the agency, suspects Ethan of being the culprit for the failed mission.

His place in the world, and finally comes to terms with what's wrong with his career and life. Recording all of his thoughts in a mission statement, Jerry feels he has a new lease on life. Unfortunately his opinions aren't met with enthusiasm from his superiors and after dishonorably being stripped of his high earning clients and elite status within the agency, Jerry steps out into the sports business armed with only one volatile client, Rod Tidwell (Cuba Gooding, Jr.), and the only person with belief in his abilities, Dorothy Boyd (Renée Zellweger), with the impossible task of rebuilding what he once had. Along the way, he faces the harsh truth which he'd ignored in the past and a host of hardships that he'd never faced before.","starting over,sports agent,single mother,idealism,football player,football,agent,telling someone to shut up,little black dress,breasts,bare butt,air quote gesture,women's group,woman wears a little black dress,woman punches a man,wishing someone good luck,whining,wedding video,wedding,wearing sunglasses to hide black eye,wearing sunglasses inside,watching football on tv,typing,two word title,tripping over,touchdown,title spoken by character,telephone conversation,support group,sports team,sports show,sister sister relationship,single parent,single mom,singing in a car,singing along with radio,sign language,sexuality,sex scene,sex on couch,selfishness,secretary,scene during opening credits,reference to zorro,reference to the super bowl,reference to the arizona state sun devils,reference to shaquille o'neal,reference to pete rose,reference to pepsi,reference to miles davis,reference to john coltrane,reference to hootie and the blowfish,reference to espn,reference to clarence thomas,reference to charlie mingus,reference to catcher in the rye,reference to audrey hepburn,reference to arizona state university,reference to albert einstein,reebok,redhead,redemption,quitting a job,punched in the face,product placement,pregnp.nancy,precocious child,overhearing a conversation,opposites attract,nfl,moving van,motivational,mother son relationship,morality,money,mission statement,mexican restaurant,marriage proposal,marriage,manuscript,male wearing an earring,male nudity,male np.nanny,male male hug,maiden,loyalty,loneliness,locker room,little league,lighting someone's cigar,lifting someone into the air,liar,lbd,kneed in the chest,kissing while having sex,kissing on a doorstep,kiss on the cheek,kiss,husband wife relationship,honesty,hollywood agent,headset,greed,goodnight kiss,goldfish in a plastic bag,goldfish,giving the finger,gameboy,friendship,fish tank,firing,fireplace poker,fired from the job,fiance,female rear nudity,female nudity,female accountant,fax transmission,favor,famous line,elevator,egotism,earth viewed from space,drunkenness,drunken man,down on his luck,divorcee,distaff,dinner date,dating,date with coworker,consciousness,close up of eyes,client,cheerleader uniform,cheerleader legs,cheerleader,character name as title,character appears on tv,career,camel,business ethics,breaking up with fiancee,boy wears eyeglasses,blowing smoke out a window,blonde woman,blond boy,blockbuster,black romance,black man,bitter woman,being asked for an autograph,begins with narration,babysitter,audio cassette,au pair,asking for a date,applejack,applause,american football,airplane trip,affection,abuse,35 year old,26 year old","1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan","USA,USA,Canada,USA,Hong Kong,South Korea,Brazil,Greece,Argentina,Germany,Norway,Taiwan,France,Australia,Chile,New Zealand,UK,Ireland,Israel,Italy,South Africa,Philippines,Netherlands,Slovenia,Denmark,Spain,Finland,Poland,Portugal,Sweden,Singapore,Turkey,Estonia,Japan,Hungary","6 December 1996,11 December 1996,13 December 1996,13 December 1996,30 January 1997,1 February 1997,14 February 1997,21 February 1997,27 February 1997,27 February 1997,28 February 1997,28 February 1997,5 March 1997,6 March 1997,6 March 1997,6 March 1997,7 March 1997,7 March 1997,7 March 1997,7 March 1997,7 March 1997,12 March 1997,13 March 1997,13 March 1997,14 March 1997,14 March 1997,14 March 1997,14 March 1997,14 March 1997,14 March 1997,27 March 1997,4 April 1997,25 April 1997,17 May 1997,22 May 1997","['Apache Junction,Arizona,USA', 'Sun Devil Stadium - 500 East Veterans Way,Tempe,Arizona,USA', 'Phoenix,Arizona,USA', 'Newport Center,Newport Beach,California,USA', 'Griffith Park - 4730 Crystal Springs Drive,Los Angeles,California,USA', 'Los Angeles International Airport - 1 World Way,Los Angeles,California,USA', '527 23rd St,Manhattan Beach,California,USA', 'Manhattan Beach,California,USA', 'Times Square,Manhattan,New York City,New York,USA', ""Paco's Tacos - 4141 S.
