Right at the outset, they are given false names with the intention that they won't get too close and will concentrate on the job instead. They are completely sure that the robbery is going to be a success. But, when the police show up right at the time and the site of the robbery, panic spreads amongst the group members, and two of them are killed in the subsequent shootout, along with a few policemen and civilians. When the remaining people assemble at the premeditated rendezvous point (a warehouse), they begin to suspect that one of them is an undercover cop.","heist gone wrong,nonlinear timeline,undercover

With a hefty bounty on the perpetrators' heads, triggered by the tough Sheriff ""Little Bill"" Daggett's insufficient sense of justice, the infamous former outlaw and now destitute Kansas hog farmer, William Munny, embarks on a murderous last mission to find the men behind the hideous crime. Along with his old partner-in-crime, Ned Logan, and the brash but inexperienced young gunman, the ""Schofield Kid"", Munny enters a perilous world he has renounced many years ago, knowing that he walks right into a deadly trap; however, he still needs to find a way to raise his motherless children.

Kaffee is known as being lazy and had arranged for a plea bargain. Downey's Aunt Ginny appoints Cmdr. Galloway to represent him. Also on the legal staff is LTJG Sam Weinberg. The team rounds up many facts and Kaffee is discovering that he is really cut out for trial work. The defense is originally based upon the fact that PFC Santiago, the victim, was given a ""CODE RED"". Santiago was basically a screw-up. At Gitmo, screw-ups aren't tolerated. Especially by Col. Nathan Jessup. In Cuba, Jessup and two senior officers try to give all the help they can, but Kaffee knows something's fishy. In the conclusion of the film, the fireworks are set off by a confrontation between Jessup and Kaffee.","lawyer,justice,judge,honor,guantanamo bay,famous line,courtroom,woman in military,washington d.c.,voice over letter,uniform,u.s. navy,u.s. marine corps,trial,suicide,rain,military lawyer,military,legal drama,jury trial,jury box,heavy rain,guantanamo bay detention camp,gender in title,four word title,flashback,fainting,duty,drunkenness,death,crime scene,courtroom drama,court martial,based on play,woman,the end,scene during opening credits,scene before opening credits,murder,man,jack daniels whiskey,cover up,woman lawyer,witness,wall,walking a wall,united states of america,unit corps god country,u.s. military,twist ending,transfer,surprise ending,superior officer,suicide by shooting self,suicide by shooting oneself in the head,softball,sexism,seafood restaurant,reference to yoo hoo drink,reference to the nazis,reference to the john f. kennedy assassination,reference to the avon lady,reference to santa claus,reference to fidel castro,reference to cocoa puffs,reference to cnn,reference to clue or cluedo,punishment,private first class,plea bargain,platoon leader,novice,not guilty verdict,not guilty plea,nervousness,nearest living relative,navy,naval officer,naval base,national security,military salute,military prison,military life,military law,military interservice rivalry,military drill,military dress uniform,military career,military base,marine corps,marine,locker,lieutenp.nant commander,lieutenp.nant colonel,lieutenp.nant,legal team,legal pad,law,lance corporal,lactic acidosis,jury,judiciary,judge advocate general,jeep,jag,hotshot lawyer,heat exhaustion,heart defect,hazing,guantanamo bay naval base,good woman,good man,gay slur,fatigues,drinking,dress whites,dishonorable discharge,cross examination,court,confession,colonel,code red,closet,blockbuster,blanket party,black male judge,based on short story,baseball bat,base commander,attorney,arraignment","3.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan","USA,USA,Spain,Italy,USA,USA,France,Australia,Denmark,South Korea,Portugal,Turkey,UK,Ireland,Argentina,Germany,Netherlands,Finland,Sweden,Philippines,Czech Republic,Hungary,Japan,Brazil,Poland,Estonia,Russia,Slovakia","2 December 1992,9 December 1992,11 December 1992,11 December 1992,11 December 1992,11 December 1992,16 December 1992,17 December 1992,18 December 1992,18 December 1992,18 December 1992,18 December 1992,1 January 1993,1 January 1993,14 January 1993,14 January 1993,14 January 1993,15 January 1993,15 January 1993,20 January 1993,5 February 1993,12 February 1993,20 February 1993,22 February 1993,16 April 1993,3 December 1993,21 October 1994,12 December 1998","['Naval Air Station Point Mugu,Point Mugu,California,USA', 'Point Mugu,California,USA', 'Georgetown,Washington,District of Columbia,USA', 'Newport Beach,California,USA', ""St Elizabeth's Hospital - 2700 Martin Luther King Jr Avenue SE,Washington,District of Columbia,USA"", '2415 20th.

During the investigation, Nick meets Catherine Tramell, a crime novelist who was Boz's girlfriend when he died. Catherine proves to be a very clever and manipulative woman, and though Nick is more or less convinced that she murdered Boz, he is unable to find any evidence. Later, when Nilsen, Nick's rival in the police, is killed, Nick suspects of Catherine's involvement in it. He then starts to play a dangerous lust-filled mind game with Catherine to nail her, but as their relationship progresses, the body count rises and contradicting evidences force Nick to start
