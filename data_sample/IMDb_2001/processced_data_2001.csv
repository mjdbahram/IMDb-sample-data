Sullivan (better known as Sulley) and his wisecracking best friend, short, green cyclops monster Mike Wazowski, discover what happens when the real world interacts with theirs in the form of a 2-year-old baby girl dubbed ""Boo,"" who accidentally sneaks into the monster world with Sulley one night. And now it's up to Sulley and Mike to send Boo back in her door before anybody finds out, especially two evil villains such as Sulley's main rival as a scarer, chameleon-like Randall (a monster that Boo is very afraid of), who possesses the ability to change the color of his skin, and Mike and Sulley's boss Mr. Waternoose, the chairman and chief executive officer of Monsters, Inc.","original story,monster world,monster,interspecies friendship,human nonhuman relationship,heartfelt,yelling,whining,villain arrested,utah teapot,two word title,tv news,toddler,title spoken by character,title ends with period,tiny tot,thought dead,sushi bar,stimulation,snake,slow motion,slapstick comedy,sense of humor,scream,scene during end credits,saying boo,satire,romanticism,roaring,rivalry,rival,redemption,recording the villain,punctuation in title,psychotronic film,precocious child,power walk,portal door,portal,pig latin,period in title,parallel world,panic,outtakes during end credits,octopus,no opening credits,mind power,mike wazowski character,male female relationship,logo,little girl,lifting someone into the air,lifting a female into the air,lie,kidnapping,jazz music,james p. sullivan character,invisibility,intergenerational friendship,improvised armor,human girl,human female,human being,human,himalaya,helicopter,hazmat suit,havoc,green skin,greed,furry monster,friendship,friend,first part,fear,father figure,factory,eye,cult film,corruption,corporation,corporate,conspiracy,computer animation,competition,companion,comma in title,collision,closet,cheating,chase,chameleon,cgi film,cgi animation,break up,boyfriend girlfriend relationship,blue fur,bloopers during credits,blockbuster,black comedy,birthday dinner,birthday,best friend,bed,baby talk,abominable snowman character,abominable snowman,3 dimensional,2000s","1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.5,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan","USA,USA,Brazil,Singapore,UK,Philippines,Venezuela,Argentina,South Africa,New Zealand,Peru,Mexico,Malaysia,Colombia,South Korea,Australia,Switzerland,Germany,Serbia,Austria,Poland,Taiwan,Czech Republic,Netherlands,Denmark,Spain,UK,Ireland,Israel,Iceland,Norway,Sweden,Hong Kong,Hungary,Slovakia,Finland,Israel,Romania,Japan,Estonia,Greece,Italy,Belgium,France,Kazakhstan,Lithuania,Portugal,Russia,Bulgaria,Egypt,Slovenia,Turkey,Madagascar,Bhutan,Togo,Kuwait,Tunisia,Guyana,Bulgaria,USA,Mexico,Portugal,Australia,Israel,Kazakhstan,Malaysia,New Zealand,Russia,Ukraine,UK,Ireland,Spain,Argentina,Hong Kong,Brazil,Taiwan,Vietnam,Bulgaria,Singapore,Estonia,Finland,Turkey,Croatia,Republic of North Macedonia,Germany,Italy,Japan","28 October 2001,2 November 2001,14 November 2001,15 November 2001,17 November 2001,29 November 2001,5 December 2001,6 December 2001,7 December 2001,13 December 2001,13 December 2001,14 December 2001,14 December 2001,21 December 2001,21 December 2001,26 December 2001,24 January 2002,31 January 2002,February 2002,1 February 2002,1 February 2002,2 February 2002,7 February 2002,7 February 2002,8 February 2002,8 February 2002,8 February 2002,8 February 2002,8 February 2002,8 February 2002,8 February 2002,8 February 2002,9 February 2002,14 February 2002,14 February 2002,15 February 2002,21 February 2002,1 March 2002,2 March 2002,15 March 2002,15 March 2002,15 March 2002,20 March 2002,20 March 2002,21 March 2002,22 March 2002,22 March 2002,22 March 2002,29 March 2002,10 April 2002,11 April 2002,19 April 2002,18 June 2002,19 July 2002,31 July 2002,13 August 2002,13 August 2002,22 November 2002,7 April 2006,19 December 2012,20 December 2012,10 January 2013,17 January 2013,17 January 2013,17 January 2013,17 January 2013,17 January 2013,17 January 2013,17 January 2013,18 January 2013,18 January 2013,1 February 2013,7 February 2013,7 February 2013,8 February 2013,8 February 2013,8 February 2013,15 February 2013,21 February 2013,22 February 2013,1 March 2013,1 March 2013,28 March 2013,28 March 2013,23 May 2013,13 June 2013,27 July 2013","['Pixar Animation Studios - 1200 Park Avenue,Emeryville,California,USA', 'Walt Disney Feature Animation - 500 S.

Harry is snatched away from his mundane existence by Rubeus Hagrid (Robbie Coltrane), the groundskeeper for Hogwarts, and quickly thrown into a world completely foreign to both him and the viewer. Famous for an incident that happened at his birth, Harry makes friends easily at his new school. He soon finds, however, that the wizarding world is far more dangerous for him than he would have imagined, and he quickly learns that not all wizards are ones to be trusted.","magic,based on
