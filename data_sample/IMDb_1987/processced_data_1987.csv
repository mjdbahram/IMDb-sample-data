The grandson is sure he won't like the story, with a romance at its core, he preferring something with lots of action and ""no kissing"". But the grandson is powerless to stop his grandfather, whose feelings he doesn't want to hurt. The story centers on Buttercup, a former farm girl who has been chosen as the princess bride to Prince Humperdinck of Florian. Buttercup does not love him, she who still laments the death of her one true love, Westley, five years ago. Westley was a hired hand on the farm, his stock answer of ""as you wish"" to any request she made of him which she came to understand was his way of saying that he loved her. But Westley went away to sea, only to be killed by the Dread Pirate Roberts.

After wasting the fresh air on the distant planet Spaceball, the good-for-nothing President Skroob orders the archvillain henchman Dark Helmet to kidnap Princess Vespa to force King Roland to provide them with the code to Druidia's atmosphere. Under those circumstances, the seasoned mercenary Lone Starr and his trusty half-human, half-canine sidekick Barf will attempt to save the Princess in distress, while at the same time, the ruthless loan-shark Pizza the Hutt is after them. But in the end, only he who can harness the mystical and mighty force known only as ""The Schwartz"" will be able to save the day.","star wars spoof,parody,winnebago,self referential,sci fi spoof,human in outer space,wilhelm scream,title spoken by character,rescue,planet enclosed within shield,film within a film,cult film,space opera,self cannibalism,xenomorph,written and directed by cast member,wedding ceremony gone awry,wedding,weapon,warp speed,waitress,vulcan nerve pinch,villain played by lead actor,villain,urination,unlikely hero,ufo,transforming robot,transformer,thin attractive woman,teleportation,technology,teacher student relationship,talking robot,swordplay,sword fighting,sword fight,surprise ending,subjective camera,stupidity,statue of liberty new york city,spoof,spaceship,spacecraft,spaceballs,space war,space travel,space exploration,space cowboy,space battle,smuggler,slender,shot in the crotch,short skirt uniform,shootout,shooting,ship,shapeshifting,shapely legs,sequel baiting,self referential humor,self destruct,sci fi parody,satire,role reversal,robot,robin hood spoof,rich snob,reference to spaceballs,reference to pepto bismol,reference to max headroom,red dress,recursion,radar jamming,psychotronic film,protagonist and antagonist played by same actor,princess,president,plastic surgeon,planet,parody of cult film,panting,outer space,opening crawl,one word title,obscene finger gesture,nurse uniform,nurse costume,neuschwanstein castle,motor home,mercedes,matched luggage,marriage,man wears eyeglasses,lightsaber,lifting someone into the air,lifting an adult into the air,lifting a female into the air,large breasts,kiss,king,kidnapping,infrared,hostage,high tech,hero,good versus evil,gold robot,friends who live together,flamethrower,flamboyant,fembot,female robot,extraterrestrial,explosion in space,escape pod,duel,diner,desert planet,desert,deliberate cruelty,damsel in distress,cult director,cult comedy,cult classic,creature,cowboy hat,cowboy boots,courage,cleavage,chase,character's point of view camera shot,canceled wedding,brunette,breaking the fourth wall,bravery,bouncing breasts,botched teleportation,blonde woman,battle,android,alien technology,alien spoof,alien spacecraft,alien invasion,alien contact,alien civilization,alien,actor playing multiple roles,absurd humor,absurd comedy,1980s","4.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan","USA,Brazil,France,West Germany,Portugal,Argentina,Uruguay,Colombia,Australia,UK,Ireland,Netherlands,Spain,Finland,Spain,Sweden,Denmark,Peru,Hong Kong,Italy,Japan,Hungary,Canada,Switzerland","24 June 1987,16 September 1987,14 October 1987,29 October 1987,31 October 1987,5 November 1987,26 November 1987,2 December 1987,10 December 1987,11 December 1987,11 December 1987,17 December 1987,18 December 1987,18 December 1987,21 December 1987,25 December 1987,26 December 1987,1988,8 January 1988,15 January 1988,11 June 1988,2 August 1990,5 February 2012,1 July 2017","['Neuschwanstein Castle,Hohenschwangau,Schwangau,Bavaria,Germany', ""St. Matthew's Episcopal Church,Pacific Palisades,Los Angeles,California,USA"", 'Stage 27,Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Studios - 10202 W.
