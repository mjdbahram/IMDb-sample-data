Young undercover cop Billy Costigan is assigned to infiltrate the mob syndicate run by gangland chief Frank Costello. While Billy quickly gains Costello's confidence, Colin Sullivan, a hardened young criminal who has infiltrated the state police as an informer for the syndicate is rising to a position of power in the Special Investigation Unit. Each man becomes deeply consumed by their double lives, gathering information about the plans and counter-plans of the operations they have penetrated. But when it becomes clear to both the mob and the police that there is a mole in their midst, Billy and Colin are suddenly in danger of being caught and exposed to the enemy - and each must race to uncover the identity of the other man in time to save themselves. But is either willing to turn on their friends and comrades they've made during their long stints undercover?","police,mobster,irish mafia,violence,organized crime,undercover cop,undercover,scantily

Vastly outnumbered, the Greeks held back the enemy in one of the most famous last stands of history. Persian King Xerxes led a Army of well over 100,000 (Persian king Xerxes before war has about 170,000 army) men to Greece and was confronted by 300 Spartans, 700 Thespians, and 400 Thebans. Xerxes waited for 10 days for King Leonidas to surrender or withdraw but left with no options he pushed forward. After 3 days of battle all the Greeks were killed. The Spartan defeat was not the one expected, as a local shepherd, named Ephialtes, defected to the Persians and informed Xerxes that the separate path through Thermopylae, which the Persians could use to outflank the Greeks, was not as heavily guarded as they thought.","spartan,battle,warrior,greece,battle of thermopylae,based on graphic novel,army,epic,blood,ancient greece,persian,5th century

Gardner has invested heavily in a device known as a ""bone density scanner"". He feels like he has it made selling these devices. However, they do not sell well as they are marginally better than x-ray at a much higher price. As Gardner works to make ends meet, his wife leaves him and he loses his apartment. Forced to live out in the streets with his son, Gardner continues to sell bone density scanners while concurrently taking on an unpaid internship as a stockbroker, with slim chances for advancement to a paid position. Before he can receive pay, he needs to outshine the competition through 6 months of training, and to sell his devices to stay afloat.","passion,motivational,hardwork,time machine,hippie,hare krishna,what happened to epilogue,unhappy marriage,underdog,troubled marriage,title spoken by character,time lapse photography,taxi,stockbroker,stadium,single father,selling blood,san francisco california,salesman,rubik's cube,real life father and son playing father and son,rags to riches,overalls,motel,marriage,manager,living in hotel,knock knock joke,job interview,internship,intern,intentionally misspelled title,innovation,hospital,homelessness,homeless shelter,homeless man,hit by a car,flat broke,finp.nancial problem,father son relationship,eviction,ends with biographical notes,chinatown san francisco,bus,break up,blockbuster,based on true story,american football,american dream,ambition,1980s","1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan","Canada,Croatia,Mexico,USA,Australia,UK,Ireland,Italy,Germany,Israel,Uruguay,Japan,France,Argentina,Netherlands,Portugal,Brazil,Denmark,Spain,Belgium,Egypt,Kuwait,Czech Republic,Bulgaria,Estonia,Finland,Iceland,Latvia,Norway,Poland,Romania,Venezuela,Hungary,Slovakia,South Africa,Greece,Thailand,Colombia,Taiwan,South Korea,Malaysia,Singapore,Burkina Faso,Sweden,Turkey,Ukraine,Philippines,Hong Kong,Serbia,Russia,Panama,Philippines,China,India","15 December 2006,15 December 2006,15 December 2006,15 December 2006,11 January 2007,12 January 2007,12 January 2007,12 January 2007,18 January 2007,18 January 2007,26 January 2007,27 January 2007,31 January 2007,1 February 2007,1 February 2007,1 February 2007,2 February 2007,2 February 2007,2 February 2007,7 February 2007,7 February 2007,7 February 2007,8 February 2007,9 February 2007,9 February 2007,9 February 2007,9 February 2007,9 February 2007,9 February 2007,9 February 2007,9 February 2007,9 February 2007,15 February 2007,15 February 2007,16 February 2007,22 February 2007,22 February 2007,23 February 2007,28 February 2007,1 March 2007,1 March 2007,1 March 2007,2 March 2007,2 March 2007,2 March 2007,8 March 2007,14 March 2007,22 March 2007,22 March 2007,22 March 2007,23 March 2007,28 March 2007,17 January 2008,14 March 2008","['Candlestick Park - 602 Jamestown Avenue,San Francisco,California,USA', 'San Francisco,California,USA', 'San Leandro,California,USA', 'Grand Lake Theater - 3200 Grand Avenue,Oakland,California,USA', 'Subway station,Glen Park,San Francisco,California,USA', ""Children's Playground,Golden Gate Park,San Francisco,California,USA"", 'Alameda,California,USA', 'Treasure Island,San Francisco Bay,California,USA', 'Oakland,California,USA']",['12 September 2005'],163566459.0,$,"Biography,Drama",0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,USA,[0.0],[0.0],0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,"English,Cantonese","[0.0, 85.1]","[5910000000.0, 37200000.0]",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,USA,2006-12-15,55000000.0,$,2654170917.0,$,2006-12-17,December 2006,163566459.0,$,,307127625.0,$,,Gabriele Muccino,[1330000.0],Steve Conrad,[9100000.0],"Will Smith,Jaden Smith,Thandie Newton,Brian Howe,James Karen,Dan Castellaneta,Kurt Fuller,Takayo Fischer,Kevin West,George Cheung,David Michael Silverman,Domenic Bove,Geoff Callan,Joyful Raven,Scott Klace","Will Smith,Thandie Newton,Jaden Smith","Chris Gardner,Christopher (as Jaden Christopher Syre Smith),Linda,Jay Twistle,Martin Frohm,Alan Frakesh,Walter Ribbon,Mrs. Chu,World's Greatest Dad,Chinese Maintenance Worker (as George K.
