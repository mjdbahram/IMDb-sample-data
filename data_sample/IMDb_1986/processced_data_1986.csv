But this time, the aliens have taken over a space colony on the moon LV-426. When the colonial marines are called upon to search the deserted space colony, they later find out that they are up against more than what they bargained for. Using specially modified machine guns and enough firepower, it's either fight or die as the space marines battle against the aliens. As the Marines do their best to defend themselves, Ripley must attempt to protect a young girl who is the sole survivor of the decimated space colony.","alien,soldier,rescue mission,xenomorph,strong

Upon arrival, he quickly discovers that his presence is quite nonessential, and is considered insignificant to the other soldiers, as he has not fought for as long as the rest of them and felt the effects of combat. Chris has two non-commissioned officers, the ill-tempered and indestructible Staff Sergeant Robert Barnes and the more pleasant and cooperative Sergeant Elias Grodin. A line is drawn between the two NCOs and a number of men in the platoon when an illegal killing occurs during a village raid. As the war continues, Chris himself draws towards psychological meltdown. And as he struggles for survival, he soon realizes he is fighting two battles, the conflict with the enemy and the conflict between the men within his platoon.","vietnam war,gore,vietnam,tropics,sweat,psychopath,napalm,murder,marijuana,jungle,infantryman,infantry,gunfire,guerilla warfare,dying young,combat fatigue,brutality,automatic weapon,automatic gunfire,american abroad,1960s,u.s. military,morley cigarettes,war crime,u.s. army,rape,race relations,mass grave,machismo,imperialism,criminal,afi,warrior,war violence,war injury,violence,village set on fire,village,underground bunker,trippy,translator,tough guy,tarmac,suicide bomber,suicide attack,stabbed with a bayonet,stabbed to death,stabbed in the crotch,stabbed in the chest,stabbed in the back,soldier,sniper,snake,shotgun,shot repeatedly,shot in the head,shot in the forehead,shot in the chest,shot in the back,shootout,self inflicted injury,sadistic psychopath,revenge,rescue,rainstorm,pump action shotgun,psychopathy,psycho,poker,person on fire,nco,national film registry,mine,military,man kills a woman,male nudity,machine gun,m 16,left behind,latrine,knife,killer,kill zone,kill,jungle warfare,jarhead,innocence lost,impersonating a soldier,impalement,helmet,helicopter,held at gunpoint,hand grenade,gunshot wound,gunfight,foot blown off,fistfight,final battle,explosion,exploding body,drug use,death threat,death,correspondence,combat,college dropout,cobra,child rape,burnt body,booby trap,bombardment,bludgeoning,blood splatter,blood,betrayal,beaten to death,bayonet,battlefield,battle,attack,army base,amputee,american war crimes,american in vietnam,american imperialism,ambush,ak 47","3.0,1.3333333333333333,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.5,0.5,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan","USA,West Germany,USA,Argentina,Brazil,Australia,Portugal,Taiwan,Italy,Philippines,Belgium,Colombia,Sweden,France,Spain,El Salvador,Finland,Uruguay,Peru,Mexico,Hong Kong,UK,Japan,Netherlands,Greece,West Germany,Denmark,Ireland,South Korea,Turkey,Norway,Hungary,Poland,East Germany,Czechoslovakia,Bosnia and Herzegovina,France","19 December 1986,February 1987,6 February 1987,19 February 1987,27 February 1987,5 March 1987,6 March 1987,7 March 1987,13 March 1987,18 March 1987,19 March 1987,19 March 1987,20 March 1987,25 March 1987,26 March 1987,26 March 1987,27 March 1987,27 March 1987,2 April 1987,3 April 1987,9 April 1987,24 April 1987,29 April 1987,29 April 1987,30 April 1987,30 April 1987,8 May 1987,8 May 1987,4 July 1987,November 1987,1 December 1987,1 September 1988,2 June 1989,1 December 1989,1 January 1990,16 August 2017,25 July 2018","['Philippines', 'Cavite,Philippines', 'Mount Maquiling,Philippines', 'Luzon,Philippines', 'Manila,Philippines']",['20 March 1986 - May 1986'],138530565.0,$,"Drama,War",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,"USA,UK","[0.0, 0.41418763830543937]","[0.0, 0.4470723964757062]",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,"English,Vietnamese","[0.0, 96.1]","[5910000000.0, 1080000000.0]",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,USA,1987-02-06,6000000.0,$,24108021.0,$,1986-12-21,December 1986,138530565.0,$,,138545632.0,$,,Oliver Stone,[145000000.0],Oliver Stone,[31000000.0],"Keith David,Forest Whitaker,Francesco Quinn,Kevin Dillon,John C.

Detective Williams also tells Jeffrey that he cannot divulge any information about what the police know.
